# As first, middle and last name were variables in variably.py file, the other side of it were **strings** i.e Ram krishan Pathak
# We can use either single or double quotes around strings. Python understands both.
# It allows for flexibility, especially if quotations are used. Eg.
movie_line = 'What film is this? "Ek chutki sindur ki keemat tum kya jano Ramesh Babu?"'
print(movie_line)

# However, if like single  qoutes, must use \ before single quote inside if a string includes a word use single quote. eg.
isl_slogan = 'Let\'s fooball' 
print(isl_slogan)

# or to simply avoid, use double quotes string on such cases. Eg
isl_slogan2 = "Let's Football"
print(isl_slogan2)
